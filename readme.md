# NFT Maker

The aim to this program is to use a Deep Convolutional GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) using [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan).


This program is made possible thanks to another repository: [NFTGrabber](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/nftgrabber)
